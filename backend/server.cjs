Generate a JSON-formatted quiz set with 15 trivia questions about the movie "{movieName}". 
The questions should be strictly from the show/movie like events happening do not relate with real life
The JSON must strictly follow this format:

{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "A trivia question about the movie",
      "answer": "The correct answer",
      "options": [
        "Option 1",
        "Option 2",
        "Option 3",
        "Option 4"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

### Strict Formatting Rules:
1. **The output must be a valid JSON string**, correctly formatted for JavaScript parsing.
2. **Use ONLY double quotes (")** for keys and string values. Do **NOT** use backslashes (\\), newlines (\\n), or special escape sequences.
3. **Do NOT include any markdown, code blocks, or extra explanations**. The response must be **pure JSON only**.
4. **Ensure exactly 15 unique trivia questions** related to the movie's **plot, characters, or production details**.
5. **Randomize the position of the correct answer** within the "options" array.
6. **Ensure all options are realistic and related to the movie**.
7. **No non-ASCII characters, special symbols, or escape sequences.** The output must be **plain JSON text**.
8. **The response must be a valid JavaScript string** when stored in a variable—do **not** use characters that require escaping in JavaScript.
9. **Each question must have 4 unique answer options**, with the correct answer placed at a **random** index.
10. **The "answer" key must always match the correct answer in the "options" array**, regardless of its position.

- All keys and values use double quotes ("").
- There are NO trailing commas.
- Nested arrays and objects are properly formatted.
